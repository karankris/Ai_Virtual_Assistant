# AI-Virtual-Assistant
AI Virtual Assistant with 10 more features by using python.

AI Virtual assistants are software programs that help you ease your day to day tasks and reduce your work load.Provide information such as weather reports, creating remainders, making search in Google etc.,.


I made this AI virtual assistant by using python language , i used some modules for many features. some modules you have already in your python libraries , but remaining modules you should download by using pip command , i'll mention those modules which you want to download. 

Modules you want to install before run the program:
 1. pyttsx3
 2. speech_recognition    -      pip install googlesearch-python
 3. wikipedia
 4. webbrowser
 5. googlesearch
 6. pywhatkit
 7. gnewsclient           -      pip install gnewsclient
 8. wolframalpha          -      pip install wolframalpha           
 9. smtplib
 10. email
 11. pygame               -      pip install pygame
 12. pyaudio

note: to install the pyaudio module many ways are there, but i highly recommend this way to follow everybody to run the code without error.

  pyaudio -- pip install pipwin , pipwin install pyaudio  
  now the pyaudio module get installed perfectly , now the program will run without any errors.
  
I used wolframalpha module , which provides the result for some basic queries and some mathematical calculation. before you use wolframalpha you should create an app-id to get the help of wolframalpha , so i recommend a youtube video for you so you can follow the steps from video atlast you will get your app-id copy that and use it in our progarm.
